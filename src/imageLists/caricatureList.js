He got to preform with these musicians for charity and I was so happy for him lol! I painted this for him in 2015 when I saw him preform in Toronto. I gave it to some staff that were at the stage to pass off to him. Who knows if he ever got it, but it was fun to paint this! https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/watch-slash-and-duff-reunite-to-jam-an-acdc-classic/',
