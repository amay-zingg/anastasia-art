        description: 'Used to listen to Bill Burr\'s Podcast a lot and he talked about this moment once and I\'ll never forget it. He got to preform with these musicians for charity and I was so happy for him lol! I painted this for him in 2015 when I saw him preform in Toronto. I gave it to some staff that were at the stage to pass off to him. Who knows if he ever got it, but it was fun to paint this!',
